## Task No. 2: Hierarchical Clustering

**🌟 Objective:** Delve into the realm of hierarchical clustering to uncover the natural groupings within a dataset. Use dendrograms to determine the optimal number of clusters and visualize the results in 2D and 3D.

### 🚀 Steps to Achieve:

1. **🔍 Exploring Dataset**
   - Begin by **loading** and **analyzing** the dataset to understand its features and structure. This initial exploration is vital for setting the stage for effective clustering.

2. **🔧 Normalization**
   - Apply **normalization** techniques to standardize the data. This ensures that all features contribute equally to the clustering process, enhancing the accuracy of your results.

3. **🌲 Hierarchical Clustering**
   - Conduct hierarchical clustering in two parts:
     - **Plot Dendrograms:** Visualize the hierarchical relationships between data points to guide the selection of the optimal number of clusters.
