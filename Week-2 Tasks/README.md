# Week 2 Tasks - Machine Learning Internship

Welcome to the Week 2 tasks for my Machine Learning Internship! This week has been packed with learning and implementing various machine learning models. Below is an overview of the tasks I've completed:

## 🌟 Task 1: Implement a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Classifier from Scratch

- **Objective:** Build a k-NN classifier from scratch.
- **Dataset:** Iris dataset.
- **Details:** This task involved implementing the k-NN algorithm from scratch and testing its performance on the Iris dataset. The goal was to understand the mechanics of k-NN and observe its results firsthand.

## 🌳 Task 2: Train and Evaluate a Decision Tree Classifier

- **Objective:** Train and evaluate a decision tree classifier using Scikit-learn.
- **Details:** Using Scikit-learn, I trained a decision tree classifier and visualized the tree structure. The task focused on interpreting the decision rules and understanding how the model makes decisions based on the input features.

## 🌲 Task 3: Implement a Random Forest Classifier with Hyperparameter Tuning

- **Objective:** Implement a random forest classifier and perform hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search CV.
- **Details:** This task involved creating a random forest classifier and optimizing its parameters using Grid Search Cross-Validation (CV). The aim was to enhance the model's performance by finding the best hyperparameters.

## 🐱‍💻 Task 4: Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier

- **Objective:** Train an SVM classifier on a complex dataset and visualize the decision boundary.
- **Details:** I trained an SVM classifier and visualized its decision boundary. This task provided insights into the capabilities of SVMs in handling complex datasets and the effectiveness of different kernels.

## 📊 Task 5: Compare Classifier Performance

- **Objective:** Compare the performance of various classifiers (logistic regression, SVM, random forest) using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- **Details:** This task involved evaluating and comparing different classifiers to understand their strengths and weaknesses. The comparison helped in assessing how each model performs under different metrics.
